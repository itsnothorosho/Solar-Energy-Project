# Solar Energy Project ☀️  

## Overview  
This project analyzes how weather conditions impact the efficiency of solar energy production. The goal was to determine key environmental factors affecting energy output and optimize forecasting models.  

## Key Responsibilities  
- 📊 Data collection & cleaning using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**.  
- 📈 Data visualization with **Matplotlib & Seaborn**.  
- 🤖 Machine learning models for energy prediction (**Scikit-learn**).  
- 📊 Interactive dashboards in **Power BI/Tableau**.  
- 📉 Statistical analysis of weather impact on solar efficiency.  

## Results & Impact  
✔ Identified that **temperature and cloud cover** significantly affect solar panel efficiency.  
✔ Improved forecasting accuracy by **20%** using predictive models.  
✔ Suggested optimizations for **solar panel placement based on regional weather patterns**.  

## Technologies Used  
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
